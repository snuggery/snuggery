			Execute a target without specifying a project. Snuggery looks for the project to run the target in:

			- If the command is executed from within a project that has the requested target, the target is executed in that project.
			- If the workspace has a default project and that project has the requested target, the target is executed in the default project.
			- If there's only one project in the entire workspace that has the requested target, the target is executed in that project.

			A list of all targets you can run without specifying the project is shown when you run \`sn help targets\`.

			This command allows overriding configured options. To see what options are available for a target, run \`sn <target> --help\`.
