	 * Define the `help` option explicitly
	 *
	 * Clipanion by default logs a help statement if `<path> --help` or `<path> -h` is executed, but
	 * it no longer does this when other parameters are present, e.g.
	 *
	 * ```bash
	 * sn run migration --help # prints statement
	 * sn run migration @angular/cli --help # prints error about unknown option --help
	 * ```
	 *
	 * Most of our commands don't need this, because they proxy extra arguments into `parseOptions`,
	 * which handles the `--help` properly. This migration command doesn't, so we have to provide the
	 * functionality to ensure we don't confuse our users by having some commands allow adding
	 * `--help` when arguments are present and some commands throwing errors if arguments are present
	 * and `--help` is passed.
