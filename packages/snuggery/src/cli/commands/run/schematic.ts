		details: `
			A schematic is a code generator that supports complex logic. It contains instructions and templates for creating or modifying your codebase.

			Schematics are published as npm packages called collections. A schematic is reference uniquely by defining both the collection's name and the schematic's name: \`<collection>:<schematic>\`, e.g. \`@schematics/angular:component\`. A workspace has a default collection, those schematics can be referenced simply by their name. If no default collection is configured, \`@schematics/angular\` is the default collection.

			This command accepts options and schematics usually also support options. The order in which your provide these options is important. The options of the Snuggery command (\`--dry-run\`, \`--force\` and \`--show-file-changes\`) must come before the name of the schematic. Any option passed after the schematic's identifier are considered options for the schematic itself.

			To get a list of available options for a schematic, run \`sn run schematic <schematic> --help\`.
